I must mention that the attitude of the staff of each game project is completely different. Every game is full of enthusiasm to welcome one group after another. China really needs to learn from this. The music of each project is so exciting!
We drove there on Children's Day in Korea. There were so many people that we parked in the parking lot at the bottom of the mountain. We queued for more than ten minutes to take the park bus and took you up😂
After entering the park, the people dispersed, but it was okay. If you don't watch the performances and parades, hurry up to queue up at this time. You must choose a seat in advance for the evening performances + fireworks, and avoid queuing for the wooden roller coaster at this time (I only thought about this after watching RM), because the wooden roller coaster is open until the evening, but it will be suspended during the fireworks show, so the people queuing are miserable, and they can't see the fireworks, and they are still waiting here...
In the end, I gave up on the animals. I really had no choice. I watched a bird show on the way. It was amazing and eye-opening

When I bought the wrong ticket, she helped me contact the manager for a refund and exchange, and it was resolved quickly. Purchasing tickets through the official partnership between Ctrip and Aibao is very convenient, and there's no need to worry about after-sales service.

First, regarding transportation, it is indeed a bit far from Seoul. Although the direct bus takes 40-50 minutes, it's very convenient, but you'll almost fall asleep on the way, especially on the return trip. Buses at night are notoriously difficult to catch, with long queues. During peak season, I recommend taking the subway back, as the connecting trains are much less crowded.

Second, there are many co-branded merchandise events, but many items are not available on-site. Every store says they don't have them, so it's a shame that they might not be available on-site. I hope they manage their inventory better and prevent scalpers from buying everything, leaving tourists who only need one or two items unable to purchase them. The tax refund for foreign visitors is located at the shop near the very end of the main entrance.

The zoo's animal species and numbers aren't particularly large, but they are well-managed. Some areas are indeed quite small; the orangutan or chimpanzee enclosure felt a bit cramped. The pandas were well cared for, but there were long queues. Near closing time, a Korean woman cut in line, which was a bit annoying; other Korean women reminded her, but she wouldn't listen.

The amusement park generally didn't have long queues, so those who enjoy the rides could ride them multiple times. The sunsets in the mountains are particularly beautiful, and there's supposedly a fireworks show; you could check it out, but don't miss the last bus.","The staff at the ticket checkpoint at the entrance of the scenic area were very patient and kind.
