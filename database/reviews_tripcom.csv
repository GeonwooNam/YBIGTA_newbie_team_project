5.0,"Feb 2, 2020","If you want to go to Korea and enjoy exciting activities, you must go to Everland!

Since I live near Gangnam

There were two ways to get there:

(1) Take bus No. 5002 from Exit 10 of Gangnam Station (Seoul Subway Line 2), 200 meters ahead. It runs every 30 minutes. 5002: via Sincheon Station - Gangnam Station - Yangjae Station.

Travel time: 40-50 minutes, fare: 2,500 won (one way)

Advantages: You can freely choose your time, and the last bus can be as late as 10 o'clock to watch the evening parade of Everland.

Disadvantages: Buses run every 30 minutes, and many people have to queue up. If the bus is full, you are not allowed to get on.

Note: You need to swipe your card when getting on the bus and before getting off the bus. Remember to press the red button next to the door before getting off the bus.
(2) One-day tour with pick-up: 360/person (including tickets) Hotel pick-up provided 11:00-15:00 Everland free time → 16:00-17:00 Shilla Duty Free Shop → 17:00 back to the hotel
Finally, I signed up for a one-day tour because I didn’t want to bother. It was very nice to have only two of us in the car that day. The driver also took us to the next itinerary very well.
Everland consists of 5 major theme areas - Earth Shopping Center, American Adventure Zone, Magic Park, European Adventure Zone, and Equator Adventure Zone. Each theme area has different adventures and romance.

The queue for the wooden roller coaster was so long that I doubted my life, but it was really exciting. It’s best not to wear earrings or anything like that. My friend’s earrings were knocked off."

And people don't need to queue for a long time, there are two parts of the zoo playground, mostly Korean natives to play."

There are all kinds of exciting rides, such as roller coasters, bungee jumping machines, etc., as well as gentle projects suitable for children, which can make the whole family have fun.

There are also wonderful performances in the park, such as animal performances, circus performances, etc., which are very interesting.

By the way, Everland has many cute animals to see, such as pandas, giraffes, elephants, etc., which children will definitely like.

In short, Everland is a good place for you to have fun and enjoy parent-child time."

We took a bus from Gangnam District and drove 40 kilometers in about an hour. The transportation was quite convenient. We booked tickets online and scanned the code to enter the park, which was very convenient."

5.0,"Jun 30, 2023","Everland is far from the city, but the ticket price is very cost-effective. There are areas and projects that you can't finish playing in a whole day for less than 200 yuan. The zoo area is very large, and the panda area is a must-visit for Chinese people. Before Fubao returns to China next year, she will go to see her and her two grandfathers who love her like a treasure. Grandpa Song saw it once, and usually there are several other handsome staff members on duty. I went to the panda house to see it twice, once in the morning and afternoon. My friend went to ride the wooden roller coaster and said it was too scary. I don't want to ride it twice again. This brave guy will also be afraid, hehe! In addition, I queued for nearly 40 minutes to play an interesting project of outdoor car watching wild animals. There are more than a dozen tigers, lions and bears in that area, which are raised freely and wandering around. There is also a small sea world, where the whole penguin family is wandering around, and the performances of several well-trained sea lions are quite interesting. There is a free bus from the park to the bus station for transportation. The bus can go to the city, and then transfer back to the hotel, which is relatively close. In short, it was a pleasant day."
5.0,"Aug 30, 2021","It's like an upgraded version of Disney and Happy Valley. It's very unique, with fairy tales and excitement. The park is very large, and one day from morning to night is not enough. I must mention that the attitude of the staff of each game project is completely different. Every game is full of enthusiasm to welcome one group after another. China really needs to learn from this. The music of each project is so exciting!
We drove there on Children's Day in Korea. There were so many people that we parked in the parking lot at the bottom of the mountain. We queued for more than ten minutes to take the park bus and took you up😂
After entering the park, the people dispersed, but it was okay. If you don't watch the performances and parades, hurry up to queue up at this time. You must choose a seat in advance for the evening performances + fireworks, and avoid queuing for the wooden roller coaster at this time (I only thought about this after watching RM), because the wooden roller coaster is open until the evening, but it will be suspended during the fireworks show, so the people queuing are miserable, and they can't see the fireworks, and they are still waiting here...
In the end, I gave up on the animals. I really had no choice. I watched a bird show on the way. It was amazing and eye-opening

5.0,"Oct 1, 2019","Overall, this theme park is pretty good. The two roller coasters that every thrill seeker must ride are the T-Express and the Rolling X-Train. The lines for these rides can be long, up to 2 hours each, but worth it."
5.0,"Oct 2, 2019","We didn't ride the car for a long time, just wandering around, and then realized that we should go to Zootopia for the morning. There are several tours in Zootopia that are spectacular and allow close encounters with the animals. The 6:30 pm parade is also very good."

5.0,"May 6, 2024","Everland is a great place for capturing memorable photos. With its vibrant colors, thrilling rides, and scenic landscapes, there are plenty of picturesque spots to explore and snap pictures. However, it's best to avoid visiting during the summer months due to the high temperatures and large crowds. The heat can be quite intense, making it less enjoyable to spend extended periods outdoors. Plus, the crowds during peak season can lead to long wait times for rides and attractions. For a more enjoyable experience, consider planning your visit during the cooler months when the weather is more pleasant and the crowds are smaller."

It's really worth a visit here. I thought it would be boring if you didn't play the amusement rides. It's very big inside and you can walk a lot. The environment is beautiful, the toilets are clean and you don't have to queue, but you have to queue for the theater. It's worth a visit."

We saw the discounted price at the ticket booth while waiting at the park entrance; it was a great deal! I hope Ctrip will offer more promotional activities.

To commemorate Ruihui and her mom being together, I'm including a photo of the three of them, plus Le Bao's dad! The Bao family are all adorable children."
5.0,"Nov 21, 2025","This amusement park is definitely worth a visit. The ticket price is quite reasonable, and just seeing the Treasure Family is worth the price of admission. The animals are all well cared for. The Safari is also highly recommended. However, the other rides seem a bit outdated and not as high-end as those at Disney or Universal Studios. The wooden roller coaster looked too scary, so I didn't dare to ride it. I didn't use the Q-pass at all, as there weren't many people that day, which was a bit of a waste."
5.0,"Aug 6, 2025","It's a must-see. I'm always so rushed when I come to Korea, but I had a rare chance to relax and visit Everland. I also had the chance to catch some stars! Everland has collaborated with NCT WISH, and you can buy NCT WISH merchandise inside the park, ride the same rides as the idols, and enjoy co-branded drinks!

They have Asia's largest wooden roller coaster 🎢, a must-try. It has three thrilling rides, so you absolutely have to try them!"

The pizza and pasta in the western restaurant are delicious! Overall, it's a great experience!"

The weather was bad that day and there were few passengers. I arrived at Everland at about 10:30. I thought I would hardly see the Aibao and the twins if I queued at this time, but it was raining and I queued for an hour and saw them. I also successfully made an appointment for the bao house. I queued three times in total and successfully saw the five treasures. On the return trip, I went directly to the parking lot to get on the bus, which was much more comfortable than queuing in the wind and rain to wait for the bus."
5.0,"Jul 25, 2023","There are few road signs in the park, and there are no Chinese maps now. Some facilities are open in the afternoon, so you have to choose your route. Ctrip booked tickets in advance. If you don't bind the Everland APP, you can scan the QR code in the order to enter the park directly. You can go to the amusement park directly. Only the tropical rain forest and birds of prey require queuing after 2 pm to enter the park."
5.0,"May 27, 2023",I really enjoyed Everland. The waiting time for the most popular rides is insane though but understandable. T express is a must go to ride. Me and my friends ended up going twice for it. When the park opened the line was insane we waited around 2.5 hours but around 5pm the waiting time was only 1.5 hours (we visited on a Thursday). I recommend downloading Everland app. You can check the waiting time for the attractions there which is super convenient!
5.0,"May 4, 2023","Even though it rained, I enjoyed Safari Lost Valley Panda World~ I was worried that there would be a lot of people because it was a holiday, but I think there weren't many because of the rain.

Among them, I prefer the lost canyon ❤️ Mainly to take the amphibious vehicle to walk around the safari, along the way camels, elephants, rhinos, antelopes, the whole journey about 15 minutes, then also have the opportunity to see lions and big brown bears, they are very obedient, will not attack people, good experience ✌🏻"

5.0,"Oct 2, 2019","This theme park is comparable to Disneyland, but with even more to offer. Besides horseback riding, it also has a wildlife park (with pandas, polar bears, and more). There are regular shows and beautiful gardens. The food is quite expensive. It's a huge place. Don't forget to pick up a map at the entrance so you can find your way around. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes. I'd definitely come back here again, as one day wouldn't be enough."

Free shuttles to nearby hotels are also available, making it very convenient. Tickets booked through Ctrip arrived quickly, and scanning the QR code to enter the park without exchanging tickets saved us time and effort."
5.0,"May 21, 2019","It's fun and cheaper than the daytime ticket price. It's really a castle in a fairy tale. However, due to the strong wind, I couldn't ride the wooden roller coaster. Although each project is very short, there are many things to play. Everyone queued up consciously. By the way, remember to bring your own raincoat for the whitewater rafting or do it first to leave enough time for the clothes to dry. Try to go earlier, otherwise there may not be enough time to play all the projects. Overall, I still had a lot of fun."
5.0,"Apr 8, 2019","I went during the Qingming Festival, and the roller coaster was closed due to the season. The ticket doesn't include a boat ride to see the tigers and other large animals; reservations are required. You can only see the park's other smaller animals. We went on a Friday, so the lines weren't too long, and some of the shows are suitable for children under seven. The float parade starts at 8 PM near the carousel. You can enjoy the evening until almost 10 PM, and you can take bus No. 5002 to Gangnam. The first stop on the 5002 bus back to the city from Everland is Gangnam Subway Station. After getting off, continue straight for about 50 meters to the subway station. The subway from Gangnam Station connects to a fashionable underground shopping street with good food, open until after 10:30 PM, so you can explore if you have time. After purchasing your ticket, Ctrip will send you a QR code on your phone. Show it at the entrance, and the ticket inspector will scan it for entry. It's very convenient."

There are winding mountain roads, which is quite dizzying."

You can go on rainy day because there will just a few people were there and no need to take long time on every event"
5.0,"Apr 14, 2023","Everland is a great place to visit and have fun no matter what season you go to. It's great for friends, lovers, or children of all ages. In the spring, you can take pictures with the carefully tended flower fields as the background, and in the summer, you can experience parades and water gun shows to beat the sweltering heat. In the fall, there's a Halloween festival, and in the winter, you can have fun on cold days by sledding! 

Since it's such a large theme park, I recommend planning your route well. Everland isn't flat, so it takes quite a while to move up and down! Unless you're just taking a quick photo at the park, I highly recommend wearing sneakers. 

Everland Tips 

I recommend downloading the dedicated app the day before your visit and making a reservation for Everland rides on the same day! If your reservation is successful, you can ride the rides without waiting!!"
5.0,"Aug 22, 2020","The park has a wide variety of activities and is suitable for family outings. The downside is that it is very far from downtown Seoul, and the one-way journey takes 2 hours by subway."
5.0,"Nov 18, 2019",A must-see when you come to Korea! It's a beautiful place. The zoo is a must-see. Buying tickets on Ctrip is very convenient; you can enter the park with a QR code. The food and restaurants are affordable. I went there on Halloween and encountered many foreign ghosts. Be sure to watch the night parade of floats before leaving.
5.0,"Nov 16, 2023","After buying the ticket, you will get a QR code immediately. You can import it into the Everland app and enter the park smoothly. There are a lot of people in the park. You have to queue for each project. The queue time for the animal viewing project is about 100 minutes. It is very convenient to eat."
5.0,"May 2, 2020","I bought my own tickets on Ctrip.com, which were cheaper: 56,000 won for adults and 47,000 won for children. I went there on May 2nd, and the flowers were beautiful, and there were animals. There were lots of fun activities included in the ticket, and you could queue up and play for free. You still can't take off your mask during the epidemic!"
5.0,"Dec 3, 2023","I went there for the Bao family. I saw Lebao eating bamboo. Fubao was sleeping all the time. He queued up three times to enter and was still sleeping. I also saw Grandpa Jiang. The other animals were also very nice. I have to say they were well cared for. I also bought a ticket with a transportation card, which I liked very much. There is a trip hut there to exchange it, which is very convenient."
5.0,"Oct 2, 2019","Everland is a great place for all ages. My favorite ride is the Model T Express, with its iconic 77-degree drop. My friend and I regretted it the moment we got on it, but after the ride, we loved it! It was so thrilling!"
4.0,"Jul 9, 2024","Everland is worth a visit, with cute pandas 🐼! Just pay attention to the weather, outdoor projects are not open on rainy days. It is a bit far from the center of Seoul, about an hour's drive away, and there will be some traffic on the road, so you need to reserve a day to play."
5.0,"Jan 12, 2024","I bought two tickets for 249, which is great value. I will buy more tickets if there is another event! You have to make an online reservation in advance for the wooden roller coaster. The worst thing is that the Android phone cannot install the reservation software! You can only use Apple to install the reservation... After making the reservation, the queue is also very long..."
5.0,"Feb 12, 2023",it’s a amazing and awesome place!really must try the roller coaster! it was super fun
5.0,"Sep 21, 2019","Everland is truly a wonderful place worth visiting! While not a global chain like Disney or Universal Studios, it has its own unique charm! The staff are passionate and enthusiastic! The environment is also lovely! The rides are comprehensive! The animals are all happily enjoying their own territories! Compared to Happy Valley, which is gradually becoming rundown in Beijing, I have to admit that Everland is incredibly well-maintained!"
5.0,"Feb 18, 2024","Although I waited in line for a long time, I got to see the Bao family as I wished. The inside and outside of the park were kept very clean and tidy.

5.0,"Jul 30, 2025","You absolutely must take the bus! Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely! After getting on the highway, there's a dedicated bus directly to the park. There's no traffic jams, and it takes about 40 minutes to get there!

You don't need a travel guide to the park! Just go spontaneously."
5.0,"Oct 1, 2019","If you are traveling with kids, this is a place you shouldn't miss. If I were a kid, I could spend a week slowly exploring the entire park and riding my favorite rides over and over again."
5.0,"Jan 4, 2020","Highly recommended. Personally, I think it's more fun than Lotte. Except for being a little far away, there's nothing wrong with it. My kids love it! Both big and small kids will love this place. The animal show is especially exciting and worth watching!"

5.0,"Dec 1, 2023","I went to Everland again before leaving Korea. I was so lucky today. I actually ran into Grandpa Jiang and took a photo with him. Fubao was still so cute. The best thing was that I also bought a work badge, Xiaofu. It was worth it today."
5.0,"Nov 1, 2022","Easy to redeem, and cheaper compare to the original price, love it so much☺️"
5.0,"Jul 9, 2019","Everland is worth a visit, there is a special bus that goes there directly, there is also a safari park inside the park, not too crowded, the longest queue is only 40 minutes. The food is relatively expensive and the quantity is small."
5.0,"May 8, 2020","It's very convenient, much cheaper than the local ones, and you can buy the electronic ticket directly. The entrance is fast. I went there for the second time. This time I went with my friends. Although I was worried, it was still reliable and suitable."
5.0,"May 30, 2023","I went to Everland to see Fu Bao! There are many cute animals and lots to see, so visit quickly before it gets too hot~!"
5.0,"Jun 26, 2019","This is my second time going to Everland. I went there once with my boyfriend last year and went again this year with three friends. The wooden roller coaster was very exciting. My boyfriend didn't like the ride, so he had to ride it twice."
5.0,"Sep 6, 2024","Very satisfied, can be used any day before the end of August. Scan the code to enter the park, and then bind the ticket to the park app to make reservations. I just wanted to see the pandas, and watched 8 rounds of pandas from 10:30 in the morning to 5:00 in the evening. I returned with two large bags of souvenirs and was satisfied. The restaurants in the park are not expensive, and the souvenirs are not expensive, cheaper than Disney. Ctrip is convenient to buy tickets, and it is the cheapest after comparing several platforms. I will go again."
3.0,"Mar 26, 2024","The big and most exciting attractions and rides as well as cable car etc are closed. Even the small rides are closed. And bec of the drizzle, the nighttime parade was cancelled. And also, some themed structures need some cleaning or a fresh coat of pain.We enjoyed only about 50% of this attraction."
5.0,"Oct 4, 2023","Please note that you can enter the park as early as possible. Tickets can be used for free queuing in the morning. Many fun attractions in the morning require online queuing. If there is no online queuing in the morning, you can only start queuing offline at 2:00 pm, which usually takes 1.5 to 2 hours."
5.0,"May 17, 2023","Everland is an outdoor theme park in South Korea. This theme park is called the Disneyland of Korea and is the country's largest outdoor theme park. Owned by Samsung, it is located in the middle of a valley. You can ride a gondola and explore the world of safari animals. See the world's first pair of liger twins."
5.0,"Feb 28, 2023","Everland, the largest amusement park in Korea! It seems like a place that people of all ages enjoy, as there are many fun rides and things to see whenever you go!"
5.0,"May 21, 2022","I went to Everland in late 2018 and it was an unforgettable experience! The park has so many thrilling rides, but unfortunately, it was an unusually cold winter, so the park closed the wooden roller coaster for safety reasons. That was a major regret. However, other attractions like the pirate ship, rapids adventure, and the double rock spin are all worth trying and guaranteed to leave a lasting impression. Hahaha!"
5.0,"Oct 6, 2019","The tickets were issued very quickly, and the Q-pass exchange at the group ticket service center was also smooth. The Everland experience was pretty good. Although it's not as good as Disney, it has its own characteristics. I advise everyone not to queue for China Moon, the number one restaurant in the park, because the food is not good. The Starbucks building is quite beautiful!"
3.0,"Aug 9, 2019","Aibo is a bit far from downtown Seoul. A taxi takes an hour and costs around 60,000 won. The subway also takes about two hours. The park is quite dated, and the route planning isn't very good, with many ups and downs, making it inconvenient. There aren't many attractions, and many are closed if you go in the morning. The Q-PASS is also an additional fee, making it a far cry from Disneyland. The good thing is that you can see the animals at the same time!"
5.0,"Aug 1, 2019","Good, except for the wooden roller coaster which had a long queue, other projects were very fast. The place is very big, and basically I couldn't play it all in one day. I only picked up a few exciting mobile games to play."
5.0,"Jun 7, 2019","The package I purchased included a full ticket + a Q-PASS for the wooden roller coaster + a 5,000 Korean won voucher. When I went to the site to pick up the Q-PASS and voucher, the staff member said that their system showed only the Q-PASS but no voucher... Is there some problem with the connection between Ctrip and Everland?"
5.0,"May 7, 2025","Very loving!! The park is always filled with happy music, and the roller coasters are not particularly scary. Mainly to see the Bao family, there are many Bao family elements, it is worth checking in."
5.0,"Jan 5, 2020",It's very suitable for taking children to play. It's great. The zoo and the amusement park are together. I went there with my children during the summer vacation. My daughter made the whole process. It was very fun. I will definitely go there again if I have the chance.
5.0,"Feb 1, 2019",It's fun and suitable for taking children. It feels like we didn't have enough time when we arrived at noon. The best thing is that the queues for any project are not long and you can queue up repeatedly. The children said they didn't play enough and want to go again next time.
5.0,"Nov 19, 2019","It is very convenient. You can scan the QR code directly when you enter the door, eliminating the need to exchange tickets. Ctrip is really very convenient. I have always chosen Ctrip for travel and will continue to order on Ctrip in the future."
5.0,"Apr 22, 2024","Although the facilities are a bit old, the Korean culture is really good. Every story is touching and interesting. Every staff member brings a good experience. I like it."
5.0,"Aug 9, 2019",This is a zoo and park under Samsung. It is very unique and exciting. The rides are also novel. The staff are also very enthusiastic and the children are very happy.
5.0,"Jun 20, 2025",Purchase the ticket with instant confirmation. You only need to scan the QR code at the entrance. Finally got to see the Bao family after so long ❤️❤️❤️
5.0,"Mar 26, 2024",It's easy to find. The customer service will explain the bus number very clearly. It doesn't matter if you don't speak English or Korean. The driver is also very stable on the road. We will meet at the designated location at night. It's easy to find.
5.0,"Mar 1, 2024","I risked my life for the lucky pig. I queued for 5 hours to see it for 5 minutes. The lucky pig is so cute. I arrived at 8 o'clock in the morning. There were a lot of people, many Chinese, and many dear ee"

4.0,"Jan 5, 2020",Everland is a very famous amusement park in South Korea. It has been open for a long time and the maintenance inside is pretty good. Everything is so cute. You won’t feel bored even if you play here for a whole day. It feels like you have entered a fairy tale world! !
5.0,"Aug 27, 2024","Come for our lovely national treasure, you can play in the park for a day. You need to download the app in advance and bind the ticket to make reservations for various venues. You can register for tax refund when the amount is full, and then you can operate it at the airport."
5.0,"Feb 5, 2024","Why did it snow when I went there? All the outdoor facilities were closed, so the kids could only play indoors. Haha. Most of the time, we had to queue up to see the pandas. Fubao was very cute. You can scan the code to queue up, but if you want to make an appointment, you still have to bind the app."
5.0,"Dec 1, 2023","I love Fubao. Many rides are closed but it doesn't matter. I just go to Fubao. The best time is from 3pm to 5pm. Generally speaking, Lebao is better."
5.0,"Jun 2, 2019","The bus arrived on time, which was very convenient! Everland is really fun! One day is not enough! The service staff are very friendly and enthusiastic! The only regret is that the bus has to return at 6:30 in the evening, so we can't see the evening fireworks show..."

4.0,"Apr 3, 2020","Everland is also one of the popular online attractions and is also one of the largest theme parks in the area. It is a pleasure to bring children here. It is very dreamy and romantic, like a poetic and picturesque scene. Many of the projects are thrilling and exciting."
4.0,"Feb 1, 2020","It's OK, but a bit far. It's quite big inside, but it's a deep pit amusement park. It's a bit tiring to walk back to the exit after playing. Although there is a cable car, there are long queues. The food in the amusement park is delicious!"
5.0,"Aug 11, 2023","I was a little worried about whether the tickets I bought on Ctrip could be used smoothly. There was no problem at all!! And after payment, you only need to scan the QR code to enter the park~ It was a great day. Fubao and Lebao are so cute!!"
5.0,"Oct 10, 2019","One of the world's four largest theme parks, operated by Samsung Group. It is a combination of a safari park and Disneyland, with many attractions and is quite fun. The wooden roller coaster is thrilling, and the animals are cute. It is worth a visit."
4.0,"May 7, 2024","It is very convenient to buy tickets on Ctrip. Just scan the code. The park facilities are a bit old. The service staff are not as enthusiastic as those in Disney, but they will respond to the children's calls. There are many projects suitable for children. There are also exciting projects. You can play all day. We went in winter. There were not many people queuing. It was OK"
4.0,"Dec 20, 2019","It's a very worthwhile place to visit. There are a lot of people there, but the transportation is not very convenient."
4.0,"Oct 20, 2019","I went to Everland during National Day, and there happened to be a Halloween parade. Many Koreans went to ride it, especially the wooden roller coaster. The queue was about 2 hours long and it was super crowded. There were also amusement parks and a zoo."
5.0,"Feb 23, 2025","It is always so simple and convenient to just book the Everland entrance ticket together with the shuttle bus round trip via Trip.com. It is the only online platform for me to buy the Everland ticket including round-trip transportation all the time so far. I am the panda lovers, so Everland is definitely the MUST visit place for me to visit for few times during my whole journey in Seoul everytime. So excited to see our pretty and lovely Bao Family this round again!! My slogan: “I(Ai) Love(Le) Fu Rui Hui” 💖🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼💖"
5.0,"Jun 28, 2024","It's convenient to enter the park, because you get a badge for entering the park during the Spring Festival. However, the environment of the park is average. Compared with the facilities in domestic amusement parks, it is still relatively simple. Most people go there to see the pandas. The line for pandas is very long. You have to queue for two hours to get in and see for five minutes. The amusement projects are also more for children, but the staff of the projects are very hard-working and enthusiastic. You don't need to queue up for small projects. You can get up in a few minutes. The main queues are for pandas and cable cars, but the cable car is also very fast, there are many slopes, and it is really tiring to walk."
5.0,"Sep 2, 2023","As long as you buy a ticket, there is no additional charge! For parents or elderly people accompanying their children, the tickets they are given are very cheap, 10-20% of the ticket price. Because they enter the park to accompany their children. Very humane! Chinese parks should learn from this! And the drinks sold in the park are the same price as those sold outside! The ones in China are super expensive! Chinese tourists are stupid and have a lot of money!"
5.0,"May 29, 2023","Amazing Fun but the queues can be extreme! I had so much fun here with some friends for a birthday, May is a good time to go without it being too hot! I highly recommend ponchos for the water rides too. there are lots of food options so you’ll find something for everyone. The animals are very cute and look well looked after. For those who may have been, Everland is the South Korean Chessington. World of Adventures! At night, the parade is awesome with super cute characters! Tickets are about 40,000 but personally worth a trip!"
5.0,"Apr 3, 2023","Everland is a massive theme park that covers about 99 hectares in size! There is also a zoo, a water park and many more themed lands."
5.0,"Sep 7, 2020","This place is definitely worth a visit, being the equivalent of South Korea's own Disneyland. The park is enormous, with a comprehensive range of rides, restaurants, restrooms, and other amenities well-spaced, and the performances are unique. However, the rides are still geared more towards adults.

The biggest drawback is that the park is too far from Seoul, over an hour's drive away. There are no hotels nearby, nor in the park itself. A full visit to the park would require at least three days, so round-trip travel is quite limited."
5.0,"Jul 10, 2025",I came to Korea to watch a concert and visited Everland for a day. I saw the Bao family. They were very cute and the tickets were very affordable.
4.0,"May 23, 2023","It gets quite hot in the summer.
A parasol or handy fan is essential.
Also, since it's in the mountains, you'll be doing a lot of walking.
I recommend wearing comfortable shoes.

The atmosphere is fun and the cast members are very enthusiastic!
I also thoroughly enjoyed the rides!"

5.0,"Feb 23, 2025","I went there for the Bao family. There were not many people on weekdays. Each time was 10 minutes, and a round lasted about 30 minutes. I was in the outer field from 10 to 10:30 in the morning. I went in to eat at the back. Generally, I fell asleep one after another at 11:30. I ate again at 3 to 5 pm. I was active."

5.0,"Feb 23, 2025","The entire park is basically supported by the Bao family in winter. Other small animals do not go out. It is too cold, and the amusement equipment is also out of service. There are relatively few people. Fortunately, the queue for the Bao family is not long. Basically, there is always a chance to see the two grandfathers in a day."
4.0,"Aug 9, 2025","I went there on Monday and there weren't many people, so I didn't have to wait in long lines. The park is quite large, and I entered at 1:30 pm and left at 7:30 pm, so I didn't have time to visit a few places."
5.0,"Feb 18, 2025",I had a lot of fun at Everland last year. I will go again this year to see Ruihui. He must have grown up a lot. I hope I can have fun this year and Lebao will get better soon. I didn’t see Fubao at that time. I will try to see some wild animals this time🤭

5.0,"Feb 28, 2024","I went to Everland for my family, especially for the cute lucky pigs. I chose Myeongdong as the place to get on and off the bus, which was very convenient. Fortunately, my fellow travelers on the same day were all on time, and the return trip was smooth..."

5.0,"Feb 4, 2024",Ctrip booking is very convenient. You can enter the park directly by scanning the QR code. You can book popular projects by binding the park app. The Bao family queued for only about 40 minutes at around 3 pm. The whole park has animals and entertainment. It was a pleasant day.

5.0,"Jul 29, 2019","Everland is definitely worth a visit. Although it's a bit of a journey from Myeongdong to Gyeonggi Province, involving taking the subway, then a bus, and then a shuttle bus, the experience at the park is quite good. It's divided into two areas: an amusement park and a zoo, making it perfect for spending a whole day with your kids."
5.0,"Feb 5, 2025","There are few people. The experience project is also very comfortable, the performance is also good, and the panda baby is so cute"
5.0,"Jan 2, 2020","This is my second time here, and the rides are all really fun! Plus, there are animals to see! Tickets are less than 200 yuan, which is a super bargain. I highly recommend it! Transportation is also very convenient; there's a shuttle bus to the amusement park entrance."
5.0,"Feb 28, 2024","Very convenient. It is recommended to wait for the bus 15 to 30 minutes in advance. There are buses on the highway from the city to the park. When there is a traffic jam, it will be faster than any chartered car. I originally wanted to hire a car for more than 1,000 yuan, but the bus with an average of more than 70 yuan per person was the right choice."
5.0,"Apr 6, 2023",a nice place for fun 😊 my first experience with friends on everland last week
5.0,"May 18, 2020","Very good, and the early bird price was very affordable. Just scan the QR code to enter the park. There are lots of fun rides. The famous wooden roller coaster is currently under repair, but I hope to ride it next time I go. Some of the rides are different in winter and summer. In winter, you can enjoy skiing."

5.0,"Dec 13, 2025","Everland in Seoul is definitely a must go place. We had so much fun there, especially the Zootopia adventure. Though the queue can be long up to 50 minutes for safari world and lost valley, but it's worth the wait. Highly recommended when in Korea!!!"
5.0,"Oct 27, 2025",Easy to use the QR code. I realised that the crowds getting lesser during evening. Whereby less time to que for the rides. There’s no water dispenser around the park to refill your water. Microwave also not available for you to reheat your outside food. There is CU Mart before the entrance if you want to grab snacks into the park.
5.0,"Sep 6, 2024","Very satisfied, both the outbound and return trips were on time. Staying in Hongdae, the boarding and alighting points are very close to the hotel. It is much more convenient than taking the subway and changing buses by yourself, but it is not suitable for people who want to have flexible time to go back and forth. There are very few people in Everland. I originally just wanted to see the pandas. The shuttle bus time is suitable, and I can see many rounds of Everland and their pandas."

Not only that, but it even has a zoo with monkeys and other animals, plus a wildlife park. You have to take a special protected vehicle to enter the restricted area. The security measures in the restricted area alone were impressive. It was fantastic. A very fulfilling day!"

5.0,"Aug 3, 2024","The first time I went to Korea was to go to Everland. I originally wanted to take a bus by myself, but then I thought I was afraid of getting lost and finally chose a round trip bus. I highly recommend taking a round trip bus, so you don't have to squeeze in with other people, especially on the way back. Seoul will be very congested in the evening. The bus has a dedicated lane and can save a lot of time. If you want to watch the fireworks, you may not be able to. The return trip is at 6:30. The bus is also very comfortable, highly recommended"
5.0,"May 28, 2024",Everland is literally Korea’s version of disneyland. but without the disney prices😂 they have a lego store and so many attractions it really felt like i was in a whole other world. the rides are so much fun im looking forward to my next trip there

5.0,"Jul 4, 2023","Mainly to see the national treasure.
The panda house is near the entrance, and I walked around without noticing.
Fortunately, I went early and applied for entry to the panda house on the Lebao app while queuing. He was a handsome guy who patiently showed me how to operate. It was relatively smooth.
The whole venue is relatively comfortable, without any odor, and the colors are bright, which is suitable for a family trip for little friends. I saw Aibao eating all the time, and Fubao kept sleeping with his head in his front paws.
By the way, the transportation is very convenient and the parking lot is relatively large."
5.0,"Aug 29, 2024","It is worth going, and there is basically no queue, including the zoo and the amusement park. But it is a certain distance from Seoul, so if you want to have a good time, it is recommended to stay there for one night."

The atmosphere was lively, and the variety of attractions made it a memorable experience. Highly recommend Everland for anyone visiting Seoul — it's a must-see for adventure lovers!"

The feeling outside was also very good, the sound of running water on the green grass"

The turn-based survival mechanics create intense decision-making scenarios, keeping players on edge. The diverse landscapes of Korea provide a unique backdrop, enhancing the immersive experience.

I asked the staff to dial two or three times before it worked. I don’t know why! I was in a hurry to see Fu Bao, so I thanked the staff and hurried on my way without asking the reason..."

5.0,"Mar 4, 2019","You can enter directly by scanning the QR code, which is convenient and cheaper than buying tickets on-site. Going in winter might be a bit of a waste, as it's very cold in Korea, and some attractions, including the zoo, will be closed. I recommend going on days other than winter. I didn't see any fireworks. They say it closes at 9 pm, but they actually turn off the lights and rush people out before 8 pm. Many attractions don't open continuously; they might only open in the afternoon. Restaurants also close early, so I suggest bringing your own food. It's different from what I'm used to in China."
5.0,"Apr 26, 2025","It feels very good. The price-performance ratio is very high. For 200+, you can see animals, play rafting, and see Aibo. Hahahahaha. There are not too many people. In addition to the popular projects, I think taking a walk is also a good place"

4.0,"Nov 3, 2025","The staff at the ticket checkpoint at the entrance of the scenic area were very patient and kind. When I bought the wrong ticket, she helped me contact the manager for a refund and exchange, and it was resolved quickly. Purchasing tickets through the official partnership between Ctrip and Aibao is very convenient, and there's no need to worry about after-sales service.

First, regarding transportation, it is indeed a bit far from Seoul. Although the direct bus takes 40-50 minutes, it's very convenient, but you'll almost fall asleep on the way, especially on the return trip. Buses at night are notoriously difficult to catch, with long queues. During peak season, I recommend taking the subway back, as the connecting trains are much less crowded.

Second, there are many co-branded merchandise events, but many items are not available on-site. Every store says they don't have them, so it's a shame that they might not be available on-site. I hope they manage their inventory better and prevent scalpers from buying everything, leaving tourists who only need one or two items unable to purchase them. The tax refund for foreign visitors is located at the shop near the very end of the main entrance.

The zoo's animal species and numbers aren't particularly large, but they are well-managed. Some areas are indeed quite small; the orangutan or chimpanzee enclosure felt a bit cramped. The pandas were well cared for, but there were long queues. Near closing time, a Korean woman cut in line, which was a bit annoying; other Korean women reminded her, but she wouldn't listen.

The amusement park generally didn't have long queues, so those who enjoy the rides could ride them multiple times. The sunsets in the mountains are particularly beautiful, and there's supposedly a fireworks show; you could check it out, but don't miss the last bus."
3.0,"Apr 10, 2025","It's a huge park!! However, many rides, including the roller coaster, were closed during winter—especially when it was snowing. Even the food stalls weren't open. The ground was quite slippery. I did quite enjoy the safari though. You definitely can't finish all the rides in one day—you'd need at least two days."
4.0,"Dec 2, 2024",Bought the Everland ticket with transport and the coach came on time on both ways.  Entry is a breeze as I just need to show the QR code at the entrance.

4.0,"Sep 11, 2024","After seeing the pandas, I arrived at the shopping spot and avoided a male cashier. I encountered him twice a year. He scanned more items every time he checked in. If there were 15 items, it would become 17 items when checking out! The second time, this Korean guy scanned an extra 490 million won Fubao. Even though it was so big, he scanned it twice. Either he had eaten too much kimchi brain or he did it on purpose! Everyone must check after checking out!"

4.0,"Feb 3, 2012","Honestly, it's not quite as good as Happy Valley in Shenzhen. It's owned by Samsung Group. From Gangnam Station on the Seoul subway, take bus 6002 (8000 won one way). Everything inside is in Korean, which can be a bit inconvenient, but thankfully some staff understand English for directions. There were many Korean kindergarten children visiting the park, which was very cute. There's also a carousel. They also have souvenirs like Mickey Mouse ears, which are relatively cheap compared to Hong Kong or major Chinese cities, so you can buy a lot. I rarely see candy vendors in Seoul, but there were quite a few here. The lines for the rides aren't long; you can get a ride quickly. There's a small supermarket at the exit where you can buy something if you get hungry, but it's expensive—a bag of shrimp chips costs 10 RMB. The whole park is colorful and has many animals, including monkeys, which are very cute. Families with children should definitely visit. Its English name is EVER LAND."

But you must grasp the time to arrive at the boarding location, and you will not be waited for after the time."
5.0,"Apr 13, 2024",It was very good. There were not many people and we took a business car. There were four people coming and two people returning. It was cost-effective. We were picked up immediately and then went to the gate. We left Hongdae at 8:50 and arrived at 10:15. Please refer to ~ There were two small traffic jams in the middle
5.0,"Sep 21, 2022","It's worth a visit, but it gets very crowded during holidays, with long queues for many attractions."
5.0,"Jan 16, 2020","Excellent! The entire amusement park is great. There are buses from downtown Seoul, and although the navigation showed it was still a 10-minute walk from there, it's actually not necessary. After arriving at the park from bus 5002, you can take a shuttle bus from the side directly to the park, which is very convenient."
5.0,"Apr 8, 2025","The animal area and the amusement facility area are quite interesting. I didn't see the magic area due to the rain, but the remaining two areas are also good. It's just that the restaurants in the park feel average (as far as the two I visited are concerned). It would be boring to go alone, so I recommend finding someone to go with."

5.0,"Jan 26, 2020","It's a great park with animals and rides. You'd definitely need two days to experience everything. Ctrip's special offer tickets were fantastic! I didn't know they were available on the first day and bought them at the park entrance, which were very expensive. Buying them on Ctrip on the second day was convenient and cheaper."

There weren't many tourists, making for a great visit. I recall there was also a zoo, the pandas were super cute, and the butterfly garden was nice too."
3.0,"Nov 22, 2023","If you're using Disney's Universal Studios as a reference, then Everland is clearly inferior in terms of the fun of the attractions, the quality of service, and its international appeal. The navigation for foreign tourists isn't very good either; there are many ups and downs within the park, and nearby points on the map often have elevation differences that make them inaccessible. This is something you should be aware of."

4.0,"Oct 26, 2024","Very fun. There are many projects. It is very suitable for family outings. The food inside is also good. It is just that you have to buy a fast pass in line, otherwise you need to queue for a long time for many projects. You can rent a stroller to put things. It is a better amusement park."
5.0,"Oct 4, 2024","The most popular attraction in Everland is Panda World. I also went there mainly to see the Panda family. The Butterfly Pavilion is especially worth a visit, it will give you a surprise, and the Capybara is very cute, and the parrot show is also wonderful."

5.0,"Dec 12, 2023",Gooood
5.0,"Oct 20, 2019","A very interesting amusement park, the key is that there are few lines, and the things inside are not expensive. Most importantly, the closing ceremony at night has a spectacular fireworks display, more extensive than Disney's. It lasts for at least 15 minutes continuously."
5.0,"Feb 23, 2025","Everland is very good, and it is convenient to book tickets on Ctrip. You can scan the code to enter the park directly. I saw Everland, Huibao, Ruibao and Everland again.

However, the staff clearly disliked Chinese people, showing great impatience when asking for directions or booking entry times. When I spoke to other staff members in Japanese to ask questions, they were very polite and patient. The difference in treatment was very obvious. The park environment was excellent, and they took very good care of the Bao family! That's undeniable."
3.0,"Mar 27, 2024","Everland Korea offers a delightful theme park experience, complete with thrilling rides and captivating attractions.

2.0,"Jul 29, 2023","I went there with high expectations, but ended up returning disappointed. There were only 2 or 3 exciting and fun projects, and the rest were basically only suitable for children. It can't be compared with Happy Valley in China. If you come here for the check-in, you can ignore my comments. If you come here on holidays, you basically don't have to queue. The bus arrives around 10:40, and then it takes another 7 or 8 minutes to walk to the gate. It took 5 hours to finish the tour. It was really boring. In the end, because the bus back left at 18:30, I found a fast food restaurant and sat there for 2 hours. In summary, I don't recommend it."

The atmosphere, the rides, and the beautiful scenery make it one of the best theme parks I’ve ever been to. Everything is well-organized, and the staff are always friendly and helpful.

4.0,"Mar 16, 2025","Do check whether you are going on a public/school holiday! Accidentally made the mistake of going on Korea's term break holiday, and the entire Everland was flooded with people, queue timings for me exceeded 1.5h for the iconic T-express and other rides. Do download the Everland App if possible as they have a function that allows you to book a timeslot for popular rides before 2pm, only after you've entered the park. It was still enjoyable, but we only managed to clear 6 rides, and we even tried to go at 9.30am before opening but the gates were already so full of people."
5.0,"Feb 25, 2025","It is always so simple and convenient to just book the Everland entrance ticket together with the shuttle bus round trip via Trip.com. I am a panda lover, so Panda World Everland is the MUST visit attraction for me to visit for several times during my whole journey in Seoul every time. So excited to see our pretty and lovely Bao Family members this round again!! Well, I will definitely visit my favourite pandas Bao Family in Everland Panda World again for my next Seoul trip. My slogan: “I(Ai) Love(Le) Fu Rui Hui”💖🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🇰🇷"

5.0,"Jan 2, 2024","Everland is still the best amusement park in South Korea. This is barely a hot take, as I’m sure many will agree with me on this one. The rides are thrilling and the theme park itself is actually large. it’s not just the attendance that’s large."
5.0,"Nov 4, 2023","Had a great day walking around Everland enjoying the autumn foliage, do take note that most foreigners do not have the everland reservation/queuing system, so there are rides during certain timings that is available for reservations only...barely took any rides that day too."
5.0,"Oct 24, 2023","been here for the first time and it was so amazing, especially the wood rollercoaster! watched running man and finally me and my husband tried the ride!"
5.0,"Oct 19, 2023",So glad I purchased my ticket on Trip as it is cheaper than what it is at the entrance of Everland. Either price will be worth it for Everland but saving is definitely better. Unless you want the fast pass as it is only offered on the Everland website. I hope Trip can offer it as well as I will definitely purchase it on here instead.
